            To give you a more transparent and clear information on how we
            process your personal data, we have divided the Privacy Notice into
            different chapters. Depending on if you are a subscriber, H&M Club
            member or if you have an H&M Account, different parts of the notice
            will apply to you. In each chapter, we describe in more detail what
            personal data we have about you and how we use it. We have also
            increased the information on your rights, for example how to get
            access to your data and how you can request to terminate the usage
            of your data.
